## TAMU CSCE643 SLAM Final Project
A simple feature-based monocular visual odometry based on OpenCV library.  
### Compilation of the source code:
  > mkdir build  
  > cd build  
  > cmake ..  
  > make  

This should give you an executable "mvo".  To use this executable, run  
  >./mvo  

### Dataset:  
If you would like to use your own dataset, remember to change file directory in the source code.  
I used the KITTI odometry dataset (sequence 00). The link of KITTI dataset is here:
